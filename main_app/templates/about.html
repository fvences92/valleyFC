    <p>Valley FC is a soccer club originated out of the San Fernando Valley founded July 2021. 
        That is why this project is designed to give the opportunity to kids, to play club soccer by making it affordable, fun, competitive, and most importantly focusing on player development. 
        Building connections and exposing our kids to city, state, national tournaments are on the bucket list which we believe could lead to them being seen by bigger clubs or college/pro scouts someday. 
        We are a small and new club with high aspirations. As we prepare for club soccer in the near future, we are excited about how far we've come. 
        Currently hosting 3 divisions 2016/2017, 2014/2015, 2010/2011, and 2012/2013 which is coming in the future. I am thankful for all those who are already part of the team. 
        Players, coaches, team managers, parents, I couldnt do it alone. Intro's coming soon! Website still under construction and improvements will be made along the way. Thanks for joining us and welcome once again. Vamos Valley FC!!! </p>
